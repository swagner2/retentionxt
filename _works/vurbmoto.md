The Challenge:
Vurbmoto needed tools to support their transition from a content-driven platform to a thriving e-commerce ecosystem. They wanted to leverage contests and events to engage their audience, increase sales, and foster brand loyalty. However, they required a solution that could integrate their online store, contests, and sponsorship obligations seamlessly.

Challenges and Pain Points
	1.	Contests and Loyalty:
Vurbmoto ran contests to engage their audience, but needed a way to connect these efforts with their e-commerce goals, encouraging contest participants to make purchases and stay engaged long-term.
	2.	Event Integration:
At motocross events, they wanted to capture participant and attendee data effortlessly while complying with contest rules and sponsor requirements.
	3.	E-Commerce Transition:
As a new e-commerce player, Vurbmoto required a scalable platform to manage sales and customer data while maintaining their focus on community-driven activities.
